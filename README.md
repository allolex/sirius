# Sirius

Sirius - A sensible default configuration for the mutt email client on OS X

## Dependencies

- Homebrew

Other dependencies are listed in `manifests/`.

## Installation

This is a work in progress, so installation is not yet streamlined. I will write an installation script as soon as the configuration is complete enough to work nearly out of the box.

Basically, you should fork this repo and clone your copy to $HOME/.sirius. Then you can symlink to anything you want in the repo.
