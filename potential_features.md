- Markdown support, especially [github flavoured](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
- Code highlighting, maybe with pygments (or something faster?)
- Google Contacts support, something like http://fsk141.com/gooey-google-contact-goodness-with-mutt/ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/goobook/1.4alpha4 http://atechnologyjobisnoexcuse.com/2010/04/google-contacts-in-mutt-and-vim/
